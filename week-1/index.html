        <p> For me personally I enjoy building upon already exisiting things, it does not matter if it's a song or code. 
            I take most of my time tinkering with existing things that fall under my hobby to better understand the subject or just to mess around.
            This image represents some of my creativity level due to the fact that I am unable to construct something from scratch only to further imporve an exisiting thing. 
            When I can't understand something I end up trying to relieve stress by playing my guitar.</p>

        <p>During class we learned the basic ideas of css. 
            We learned that css is the code to stylelise your own code, and there are two ways of doing it. 
            There is inline and external css code, in line coding would be using "style" in the code you would like to style. 
            While external coding would be using "link rel='stylesheet' href='style.css' and that would connect your html code with your css page.

            <p>My future goals for this program is one finishing it, as well as becoming a good coder.
                My ultimate goal for myself is beaing able to apply for a job as a game develpoer in my favorite company, Treyarch.
                From what I can tell from the seals is that it is teachignh me to be responsible as well as not to be lazy in any kind of way.
                It is as well teaching me a way of indenpendence and responsiblity and acountablity.
                But in the end what I strived to be is to be a game developer.
